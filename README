         Welcome to the Oscar compute cluster at the Brown University
                   Center for Computation and Visualization

                 Documentation:                 Email support:

Do not run your applications directly on this login node! Instead use:

interact - Launch an interactive session on a compute node
sbatch   - Submit a batch script to the queue

Other useful commands:

module   - Find and load software modules
myquota  - View your disk quota
myq      - List your running and queued jobs
allq     - List all running and queued jobs
nodes    - Summarize the compute nodes and their properties

There is a sample "batch.script" file in your home directory that shows how to
launch a serial job on the compute cluster.

You can find more examples of batch scripts for threaded and MPI jobs in
the "batch_scripts" subdirectory in your home directory.

In each home directory there are "scratch" and "data" links pointing to the
filesystems for temporary/scratch and long-term storage, respectively.
